# Open Source Live Chat For CRM

An app with AngularJS on the fron, Socket.io + Express + Node on the back. 

Contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball) and
you're ready to develop your application.

This app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Socket.io and Express
on the server.
